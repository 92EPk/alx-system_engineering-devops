Postmortem: Major Web Application Outage in 2024
------------------------------------------------

Issue Summary
-------------

On June 15, 2024, our company's main web application experienced a significant outage from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM UTC. During this period, approximately 80% of our users were impacted, experiencing slow response times and unresponsiveness when accessing the application. The root cause was identified as a database overload due to a sudden spike in traffic from a viral blog post.Timeline of events during the outage

Timeline of Events
------------------

-   9:45 AM UTC: Our monitoring system, Prometheus, detected a sharp increase in response times for the web application.
-   9:50 AM UTC: The on-call engineer, Sarah, received an alert from PagerDuty and began investigating the issue.
-   10:00 AM UTC: The web application became completely unresponsive for most users, triggering a high-severity incident in our incident management system, OpsGenie.
-   10:05 AM UTC: Sarah suspected a database issue and started checking database logs and metrics in Grafana.
-   10:15 AM UTC: The database team was notified via OpsGenie and joined the investigation in our incident response Slack channel.
-   10:30 AM UTC: The team identified a specific database query that was causing the overload by analyzing slow query logs.
-   10:45 AM UTC: A temporary fix was implemented by caching the results of the problematic query using Redis.
-   11:00 AM UTC: The caching solution helped restore partial functionality, but the system remained under heavy load.
-   11:15 AM UTC: The decision was made to temporarily disable the blog post feature in our content management system to reduce traffic.
-   11:30 AM UTC: With the reduced traffic, the system stabilized, and normal operations resumed.

Root Cause and Resolution
-------------------------

The outage was caused by a sudden spike in traffic due to a viral blog post, which led to an excessive number of database queries. A specific query that retrieved post comments was not optimized for high traffic, resulting in a database overload.To resolve the issue, a temporary caching solution was implemented for the problematic query using Redis, and the blog post feature was disabled to mitigate traffic. These actions helped restore normal functionality, but further steps were necessary for a permanent fix.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
------------------------------------

To prevent similar outages in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:

1.  Optimize Database Queries: Analyze and optimize the specific query that caused the overload, including indexing and query rewriting.
2.  Implement Comprehensive Caching: Develop a robust caching strategy using Redis to handle high traffic scenarios and reduce database load.
3.  Scale Database Infrastructure: Evaluate and enhance the current database infrastructure, considering horizontal scaling with additional nodes or vertical scaling with more powerful hardware.
4.  Enhance Monitoring and Alerting: Improve monitoring systems like Prometheus to provide better insights into database performance and set appropriate alerting thresholds.
5.  Conduct Regular Load Testing: Perform load tests using tools like Locust to identify potential bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle expected traffic spikes.
6.  Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Implement a CDN like Cloudflare for serving static assets to reduce load on web servers and the database.
7.  Improve Content Promotion Strategy: Develop a controlled approach to promoting blog posts to avoid sudden traffic spikes, such as gradually rolling out content to a subset of users.

By addressing these areas, we aim to enhance the resilience and scalability of our system, reducing the likelihood of similar outages in the future.
